CrazyDiv
=========

##### Instructions

Come up with a nice way to display the data provided and render it within the crazydiv div.  See the JS file for the data.  Your implementation will have to deal with the *CRAZINESS* of the div.  You can add whatever files you find necessary.  You can also edit any of the provided files are long as you aren't trying to take the crazy out of CrazyDiv ;-)


#####Requirements

* Must work in all relatively modern browsers (IE 8+, Firefox 4+, Chrome 10+, Safari 5.1+)
* Presentation should reasonably display in all shapes and sizes dictated by the crazydiv
* No browser plugins


##### Data Format

The JSON data are achievements.  Each achievement has its name, point value, category names for which is belongs, and a few stats values.  There are 1500 achievements.

```
[
{
  "name": "Check out Monument Valley in Utah",
  "point_value": 10,
  "categories": [
    "Checking Out Nature",
    "Natural Phenomena"
  ],
  "num_users_ignored": 0,
  "num_users_added": 4,
  "num_users_accomplished": 4
},
...
]
```
