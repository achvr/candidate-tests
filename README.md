## What is this?

These will be little exercises we can give potential candidates.  We're going
to start with one called CrazyDiv but will add more soon.

## What do I need to do?

Clone this repo.  Add your work, commit, push.  Open a pull request.

## CrazyDiv

The idea with CrazyDiv is to test the candidate's ability to deal with "real world" web dev problem -- limited and dynamic presentation space.  CrazyDiv also tests candidate's ability to creatively display interesting data.
